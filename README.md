# Spelling Bee

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

Let's make something like Dragon Warrior, except every encounter is a Scrabble contest.

Copied the 2023 NASPA word list and eliminated all words >7 letters; they won't be reachable.
Gives us about 57k words in a 400 kB resource.

## TODO

- [ ] Multiplier stamps.
- [ ] Animate rejected words.
- [ ] Animate length bonuses.
- [ ] Fancy up the encounter graphics.
- [ ] Outer world.
- [ ] Sound effects.
- [ ] Music.
